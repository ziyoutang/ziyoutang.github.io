            <span class="title">The Panel with the Withered Flowers</span>

            Morning light shines through the azure glaze of glass, emanating a sense of serenity intrinsic to the Zen culture of Mushin. Chilliness still hasn't attenuated from dusk. Birds were chirping to the widening view of dawn, circling each other. A whisk of wind pushed open the door of the austere byouin, screeching as it brushed against the dry leaves that still weren’t cleared after three months of passing Autumn. The byouin was archaic and often seen as abandoned, for it was almost ten miles away from the city; it was once a place that used to be accustomed to the officials of imperialism in the 1938s during the Sino-Japanese War. The relic of the war was still left on the walls. Yet, the aura of secular customs was elapsed, leaving a rather refined ambiance, however emotionless, with no hostility, no renders of vengeance or exuberance.
            
            The architecture looked constrained; the dark black paint had already disintegrated from the structure, leaving black splatters of abstract shapes on the rough pillar that supports the four stories of the architecture. It was unpleasant to the eye to see such a place, similarly to the crooked branches that circle the area. 
            
            Yet it wasn’t distasteful to him, for the words “beauty” and “sublime” were not in his world of words or sight. He has respectively no emotion or judgments about anything, and he couldn’t find a way to feel disgusted toward the desolated structure. It was just not a capability he had. He was seated on the wooden stool placed along the side of the hallway of the byouin, located near the opening of the blood donation apartment. 
            
            
            The screeching of the door left him unmoved. Surprising as it sounds, there were lots of people working in this byouin, making him adapt to the constant screeching of the door, with people passing into the hallway and stairs, moving up and down accompanied by the subtle clutters of leather-heeled shoes. 
            
            The area was still chilly, in his opinion. He can’t stand how people try to make themselves look busy when they’re clearly not; maybe people just never realize this ludicrous phenomenon, or they wanted to simply feel good about themselves, neglecting the fallacy in front of them. 
            
            He was facing a wooden panel that was used to block out the fractured window. The wooden board now fell lopsided, fabricating an imbalance scene over the surface. The edges of the material were already molded, sogged from rapid summer rainfall. He stared at the framework from edge to edge as he had always done. When someone passes his vision, he stares past the pedestrian’s silhouette. It was futile to observe the people passing him, for he had already done all of that when he was still young. 
            
            It was tedious.

            
             He stared blankly, neglecting the grasp of hair that covers half of his almond-shaped eye, a pair of eyes that seemed feminine under the orange light that extended its hand through the window. His lips were pressed close, dried from the brushing of air. To say that he looked amiable was not a lie. Yet the flavor of youth printed on his face has already vanished, making him seem older than his age. His eyebrows were grown, sighifying how masculine he was, yet his profile was soft and rounded, slim, almost thin from the lack of appetite. 
            
            He knew he was too mature for the customs most people believed in. Yet he conflicted with this thought. Not fitting in was a crime that haunted him for the past years when he was diagnosed with Stendhal Syndrome. It was almost an indignity for him even to be diagnosed with it. Eventually, he got used to it. He couldn’t care less about what people thought of it. His parents left him because he couldn’t handle the modernized beauty of Japan. It was painstaking for his heart. The disorder left him open to another level, another realm of imagination or reality that he was meant to appreciate. It was the stereotypical ugly that was a beauty to him. Or something over the bound of beauty, for there was only a shallow definition when the concept was first introduced to him. 
            
            He was in a kimono stuck with patches, rendering his slim lines, when a single flower was placed gingerly onto his legs. He didn’t even bother to avert his eyes, for he was the closest stranger with everyone in this dreary byouin. He knew who placed it even if it surprised him a little, so faint that he quickly drove the feeling away. 
            
            “You enjoy it, don’t you?” He spoke. 
            
            He heard a pause. 
            
            “Excuse me?” 
            
            He said nothing. 
            
            “I don’t get your point. You just asked me a question, and now you’re not even explain-” 
            
            He stared blankly at the window, unmoved. The flower was still lying on his legs. 
            
            She sighed, taking a step to block his vision. He frowned. 
            
            “Are you just planning to sit on this stool for the rest of your life?” 
            
            He lifted his eyes and sighaled toward the blood donation apartment. 
            
            “You enjoy doing that.” 
            
            She lifted one eyebrow in confusion, then her face flushed red. 
            
            “What do you mean?” She stuttered. 
            
            “You know it.” 
            
            She paused. 
            
            “Yes, I do enjoy it; it’s part of the shinto culture to do good for the others -” 
            
            “It’s not that.” 
            
            Now, she was even more flustered. 
            
            “Who are you to say that?”
            
            He ignored her and moved his body to continue staring at the window. 
            
            She was about to walk away when she stopped. 
            
            “You’re staring at space because you live in a parallel realm. You’re wearing a hospital gown when you have nothing wrong with you. You’re too mature, and you can’t embrace that fact.”
            
            “Embracing facts is a sense of beauty, and nothing could be called or labeled as beauty.”
            
            “You’re not speaking with your rational mind. I don’t seem to understand the connection between the two. I only know that you have a great misunderstanding about beauty.”
            
            “No, I don’t. It’s just a cover for approval; beauty is a hypocritical word.” He was now staring at the red poppy placed on his lap. It was so red, deep yet vibrant. He always thought the bright color was abrupt and overwhelming in the tranquil culture of Japan; yet, this byouin offered such flowers to anyone who donated their blood. 
            
            “You don’t -”
            
            “How many red poppies have you received?” 
            
            She was getting used to how he interrupted her words. “12 in total.”
            
            Oh.
            
            “12 months.” She murmured. 
            
            “You should go.”
            
            Again she was flustered. She couldn’t understand him at all. She was compassionate enough to leave him a red poppy, yet he muddled a few incomprehensible words. 
            
            “You achieved your purpose, didn’t you? So leave.” He paused. 
            
            Nothing. 
            
            “You got the attention you wanted from your blood donating actions. So leave.” 
            
            She was out of words. She was irritated. She didn’t like it at all. She didn’t like that her brain believed in what he said. 
            
            The boy found the conversation interesting. He never thought talking to a secular-minded girl could be filled with enlightenment. But instead, it was a sparkling sensation. 
            
            Knowing that the girl was still there, he moved his eyes to focus on the girl, not something he used to do. 
            
            He has done such several abnormal things in just 7 minutes unrealized. 
            
            The girl has wide eyes; the end of her eyelid met the corner of her eyes, drooping down elegantly. She was not exactly pretty, even though beauty was not defined. Her hair was tied using a Kanzashi, strands loosely falling beside her temple. Her eyes were the same color as her Kanzashi, an emerald brown mixed with green. 
            
            The girl was now also staring into his eyes. 
            
            “Sure.  I must not deny that you spoke the truth. Accepting this truth, for it’s against the essence of modesty,” She simply said, leaving the boy blankly staring across the wood panels. 
            
            “Now you’re the one who speaks nonsense.” 
            
            She didn’t reply. 
            
            “Isamu.” 
            
            What a name. 
            
            She laughed bitterly.  “What a contrary. Ahma.” 
            
            You too, he thought.
            
             The girl left, and he was back admiring the disturbed wood panels. 
            
            
            
            
            November 27th - A month after that day
            
            A lily was placed together with the red poppies in the blood-donating apartment. 
            
            Ahma received it. She looked out. 
            
            Isamu was staring blankly at the panels again. 
            
            Who gave it to her?  
            
            She looked again.
            
            Oh.
            
            —--------
            
            “Why don’t you stand up from your stool?” She called. 
            
            “This is the only place I belong to.” 
            
            “You surely don’t sleep here.”
            
            “...” 
            
            He sighed. “You’re giving me another red poppy?” 
            
            “To add more chaos to the ripped petals, you stuck on the window.” 
            
            “...”
            
            “I like chaos, did you know” 
            
            “...”
            
            “Let's go somewhere.” She added. 
            
            “Where?”
            
            “Somewhere for the souls so imperfect that it becomes perfect for your realm.”
            
            “You don’t understand my condition.”
            
            “Sure.” 
            
            And yet he followed her steps. 
            
            
            
            
            “Like it?”
            
            “...”
            
            “It’s Wabi-Sabi.”
            
            “...” 
            
            “I think you liked it. You’re staring at it.”
            
            “...” 
            
            “Staring at it more fondly than the windows.”
            
            He was looking at the city in front of him. The town that threw him into inflammation, swamps, over and over again. Most importantly, a work of perfection that was seen against modern standards. 
            
            Yet he didn’t feel anything. 
            
            He was supposed to feel a pain in the heart. Then, he was supposed to lose his mind and faint in the middle of cries. 
            
            He didn’t. 
            
            He watched the city through the debris of the Chashitsu, through a fissure covered with spider webs. 
            
            He stared. 
            
            Imperfections.
            
            She interrupted his loss of thoughts. “That’s beauty. No matter how you believe there is no definition to beauty, this is it.” 
            
            He stared. 
            
            “You’re not blinking.” 
            
            He continues to stare.
            
            “New perspective of watching your home, isn’t it? You seemed like someone who would like imperfection, a sense of Wabi Sabi in nature.” 
            
            “That’s not my home.”
            
            “...”
            
            “You surely live in one of those buildings. Only the people in the village know about this byouin.” 
            
            “That’s not my home.”
            
            “...”
            
            “I live upstairs.”
            
            “...”
            
            “The byouin?”
            
            Pause. 
            
            “ I have Stendhal Syndrome.”
            
            Pause. 
            
            “Disorder that avoids the phenomena of great beauty and antiquity.” 
            
            Pause. 
            
            “It’s hard for me to accept what people claim as modernized beauty. Yet, somehow, I am anachronistic. They say I have a peculiar type of this syndrome; instead of not being able to appreciate the great arts, I can’t look at the modernized state of the city.”
            
            Pause.
            
            “Yet I’m looking at one now.”
            
            She now peered over the convoluted branches, staring into Isamu’s sides. The sun has set, leaving only the last grip of sunlight reflecting brightly through his pupils. His eyes were brown, a pair of eyes that were either filled with nothing or with everything. His jawlines were softened, and his eyes were not so frigid. He looked more like a boy his age at this minute and this second. Yet his soft look couldn’t conceal the dark bruises on his collarbone. Her eyes saddened, imagining what he’s been through. It reminded her of herself. 
            
            Her life was brutal to her in another way. Yet she smiled at the boy. 
            
            “It’s the perspective you see the village through that doesn’t make you feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? When you watch the village through the branches, it’s a scene of wabi-sabi. It’s the perfect place to practice Zen and the place just to appreciate..” 
            
            “You’ve said that already.”
            
            Pause. 
            
            He was looking at Ahma from the corner of his eyes. Somehow, her smile wasn’t genuine. Instead, it was filled with pain that fluctuated endlessly. 
            
            “Why don’t you try zen?” She whispered. 
            
            “That’s so useless.”
            
            
            Pause. 
            
            “But is Zen the branches…”
            
            “It’s the feeling you experience when you watch the view.”
            
            Pause. 
            
            She gave in when he didn’t say anything. “Well, yes, it is. The branches are Zen. ” 
            
            “Oh. Then maybe.”
            
            She chuckled. It was a bitter chuckle. 
            
            He didn’t speak. 
            
            “Thank you for the lily, by the way. For giving me the symbol of purity and beauty.” She said. 
            
            He paused. 
            
            “I simply thought the red poppies you collect weren’t suitable. It symbolizes war, the physical and emotional war, and most of all the decaying of life.” He shrugged. 
            
            “It’s more to me. It reminds me of a countdown, and I like the feeling of it.” She replied. 
            
            Countdown. He missed the word. 
            
            None of them spoke after that. He was staring at the dark branches that crossed the illuminating yellow lights flickering through the village. She was staring at the same view but more focused on the intense beating of her heart. Time passed, yet nothing changed. She was in the state of meditation, reaching for the cores of Zen while he hummed a tune so distant that it echoed in the woods. 
            
            “Isamu, what does it feel like to die?”
            
            “To die physically.” She added. 
            
            He stopped humming. 
            
            “Oh….you never know.”
            
            “It’s always fascinating to see people willing to die willingly. Like how the Samurai perform Seppuku.” 
            
            “I sometimes feel like dying willingly is better than simply living.” She snickered. 
            
            Pause. 
            
            Her voice was shivering. 
            
            “What’s the reason for asking?” 
            
            “Nothing.” 
            
            Pause. 
            
            “The mornings are even better looking.” She changed the topic. 
            
            “Here?”
            
            She hummed. 
            
            “Wait until you watch the pink surface from the horizon's end and fly into the clouds.” 
            
            She stood up from the wooden seat, taking her leave. She felt that she would have longed to stay here if she didn't go now. Longing too much for her needs. She sniffed. 
            
            “Thank you.” Her voice shivered, 
            
            Pause. 
            
            “It’s for the Lily and how you exposed me. Thank you. 
            
            “Will we meet every 27th of the month again?” He murmured. 
            
            “Perhaps.”
            
            Perhaps.
            
            “Isamu, thank you again.” 
            
            He hummed. He wasn’t looking at the girl. He was still staring through the gaps to the view of the village. 
            
            It was making him so insusceptible to anything unrelated to the view. 
            
            It was an insusceptibility that could never be a parable.
            
            
            
            December 27th 
            
            He was facing the wooden panel that blocked out the fractured window—sitting on the same wooden stool as usual. However, anyone who passed him could see a hint of joy in his eyes. It was only a slight outburst of joy in his eyes, but it was so evident because he usually looked cold and distancing. 
            
            It was 7 in the morning. She should be walking over the hallway by now. 
            
            It was 8 in the morning. She should be walking out of the blood donation room at this moment. 
            
            It was 10 in the morning—no sigh of Ahma. 
            
            It was 1 in the afternoon. 
            
            It was 4 in the afternoon. 
            
            The sun has already set. No sigh. 
            
            He couldn’t focus on the window like he used to do anymore. He knocked on the door of the blood donation room. No one replied. 
            
            She could have forgotten. He sighed. He shouldn’t be thinking so much of her. 
            
            
            He was not in his usual seat the following day. 
            
            It was 5 am, and he was now rustling through the woods to the place she showed him on November 27th. 
            
            He sat looking at the sun rising orange against the pink sky. It was a sublime view, and he knew why she liked it better than the night, even though he still preferred the dusk. 
            
            Perhaps. Something rang in his mind. 
            
            He sat down on the wooden seat to feel something clatter on his side. 
            
            It was a crystal vase filled with flowers. It was stupid that he didn’t see it earlier. 
            
            It was no ordinary art of Ikebana. A handful of red poppies circled a piece of lily, the stems barely sustaining the flower’s leaves. The red poppies are in the worst conditions. Some have already died, and some are in the process of dying.  He counted the number of red poppies—11 in total. 
            
            Of course, she gave one of them to him. He tapped the vase twice. A crystallized sound echoed shortly, similar to the wind chimes that swayed side by side when a wind grasped it tenderly. His taps moved the vase, revealing the corner of an archaic piece of paper. 
            
            He paused. 
            
            He lifted the vase only to stare at his name, written carefully in the middle of the envelope. His name was spelled mistakenly, and how obvious it was from Ahma that he opened the envelope immediately to see what was inside. Three long paragraphs filled the page. He stared at the wrinkles on the paper before reading the text: 
            
            To Isamu, 
            
            I apologize that I can’t see you this December 27th or any following 27th. One of my biggest regrets is that we only got to see each other and spend time with each other for two days. But I guess it’s enough. Who in these busy days is willing to spend a whole day with each other to understand the universe, humanity, and themselves? Only us, which is why I cherish the day of November 27th so much. 
            
            The first day we met, you exposed me right off the bat. Although I was selfish, you were right but not entirely right about why I was so selfish. I was already diagnosed with Paralysis and wanted to feel the willingness of death. I wanted to feel how it was to die of my own will. To feel the blood drain out of my body. The nurses in the byouin could only satisfy my wish, for it’s my only desire. I guess this is a type of Seppuku, isn’t it? But I know it’s not, for all these actions were selfish and egocentric. 
            
            Isamu, thank you for November 27th and the 1-hour conversation on October 27th. I thank myself for giving you the red poppies to meet such a soul, a spirit similar to yet different from mine. You’ve gone through so much more than me, and I would have loved to accompany you to overcome your hardship. However, the doctor just informed me that it might be the time when I stop walking, moving, and breathing the wood scent of air filled in this byouin. I’m gone by the time you see this. Such an iconic drama tragedy line, isn’t it? Of course, what upset me the most was that I couldn’t visit the sunrise and the sunset, the Wabi-Sabi, which was my remedy for such a long time. However, what relieved me was that I told you this spot, this place so precious to you and me. I’ve also kept the flowers I treasured. Each flower represents each month I continued to live. And the lily sighifies more. And let me propose a narcissistic desire. Would you keep the flowers for me and paste them on the wooden panels you continue to stare at every day across the hallway? I wish I could still leave the last imprint on this planet and feel it vanish as the sand of the wind brushes it away. I still want some attention; I'm not as mature as you. 
            
            May you always think of Zen when you’re upset. 
            
            Yours, 
            Ahma
            
            He stared at the paper. Maybe his heart hurt a little, but he denied it. Instead, he put the vase of flowers on his lap and continued to stare at the rising sun that showered its light over the village. 
            
            
            
            It was Spring, and the same whisk of wind pushed open the door of the austere byouin. It was not so chilly as the autumn wind, more warm and refreshing. The door's opening reveals the same boy staring at the wooden panel across him for almost 11 years. He looked not much different from just six months ago when the autumn passed; however, anyone who stayed at this byouin for over six months knows that the boy has changed completely. His eyes were not so blank and empty anymore. Instead, there was a never-ending fondness that filled his eyes. Anyone who passed him would stare at the object he was staring towards. His passion was aspiring. 
            
             It was the same wooden panel used to block out the fractured window that he was staring at. But now, it was taped with a few more brown withered flowers: 11 flowers have a hint of red, and one has a white hue. Instead of saying the red “flowers” were circling the white, it was more like a few remnants of dried brown that created a disorganized circle. Yet that was the definition of what he adored, what she loved, and what both wished for. It was never to be replaced. Only the two of them understand the beauty of this work. It’s Wabi-Sabi and not just that; it’s the story of Isamu and Ahma. 
            
            The story of flowers, culture, individuality, relationships, and ai.
